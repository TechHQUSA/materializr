// N-profile sketch loft (2+).
//
// Selection contract:
//   * 2+ sketches (or regions) selected -> the action lofts through ALL of
//                              them in click order, producing a new solid.
//   * 1 sketch / region selected -> the action stashes the request as the
//                              "LoftPickSecond" interactive-op so Application
//                              can render a hint popup telling the user to
//                              Ctrl-click more sketches and click Loft again.
//
// We pull the outer wire of each sketch's outermost region — for the common
// case (one closed loop per profile sketch) that's exactly what
// BRepOffsetAPI_ThruSections needs.
//
// The button is registered under both HasSketches AND HasSketchRegions: when
// the user clicks inside a closed region the toolbar switches to the Region
// panel and HasSketches no longer matches, but SketchRegion entries carry
// their parent sketch id so we can route either selection through the same
// action.
