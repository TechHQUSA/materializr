# Materializr

Open-source parametric 3D CAD

Materializr is a desktop CAD application built with OpenCASCADE Technology for
solid modeling, Dear ImGui for the interface, and OpenGL for rendering. It
provides a linear parametric design history, a 2D constraint-based sketcher,
unified push/pull modeling, and a broad set of operations in a single
lightweight binary.

## Quick Start (AppImage)

Pre-built AppImage — no install, no dependencies:

```bash
chmod +x Materializr-aarch64.AppImage
./Materializr-aarch64.AppImage
```

To build the AppImage yourself:

```bash
./scripts/build-appimage.sh
# Output: dist/Materializr-<arch>.AppImage
```

Requires Docker with BuildKit enabled.

## Features

### Modeling Operations

- **Push / Pull** — unified extrude/cut. Select a body face → **Push/Pull** → an
  arrow points out along the face normal; drag it (or type) to add material
  (positive) or cut in (negative), with a live mm measurement. Also works on
  sketch regions. Unions auto-merge coplanar/cotangent faces so seams disappear.
- **Extrude** — interactive extrude with live preview, draft angle,
  boolean modes
- **Revolve** — profile around an axis, 0–360°
- **Sweep** — profile along a path curve
- **Loft** — through multiple cross-section profiles
- **Fillet** — pick edge(s) → **Fillet** → drag the outward handle (or type) to
  set the radius, with live preview and a measurement readout
- **Chamfer** — same flow as Fillet for a chamfer distance
- **Shell** — hollow a solid with uniform wall thickness
- **Offset Face** — push or pull individual faces
- **Split X / Y / Z** — divide the selected body with a plane through its
  bounding-box centre, perpendicular to the chosen axis
- **Boolean** — Union, Subtract, Intersect (Ctrl+click two bodies); unions
  are post-processed with `ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain` so smooth merges
  don't leave a seam edge between the original bodies
- **Move / Rotate / Scale** — interactive gizmos selected from the Transform group:
  arrows (move), rings (rotate, **soft-snaps to 45°**), cubes (scale, **per-axis or
  uniform**); each shows a live mm / degree / percent readout while dragging. Scale
  also has a side panel for exact X/Y/Z percentages.
- **Mirror** — one **Mirror** button → popup to mirror across **X / Y / Z** or
  **a face you then click**
- **Linear Pattern** — repeat along a direction
- **Radial Pattern** — repeat around an axis
- **Copy / Duplicate** — clone selected bodies
- **Delete** — remove bodies (undoable, including from the Items panel)
- **Align** — point-to-point snap
- **Construction Planes** — custom reference planes for sketching

### 2D Sketching

- **Tools**: Line, Circle, Rectangle, Arc, Spline, Polygon, Text
- **Sketch from scratch on a base plane** — with nothing selected, **Sketch on
  XY / XZ / YZ** starts a sketch on that base plane with the matching standard
  view (Top / Front / Right); no body required
- **Sketch on any planar face** — toolbar button when a face is selected
  or right-click → *Sketch on this Face*; the sketch's plane is taken
  directly from the face
- **Persistent sketches** — finishing a sketch saves it into the document's
  Items panel; it doesn't auto-extrude. Select it (or a region of it) later to
  **Edit Sketch** (continue drawing) or **Push/Pull** an enclosed region
- **General region detection** — the sketch's geometry is partitioned into
  atomic planar regions using the boolean engine, so *intersecting and
  overlapping shapes* (the lens between two circles, an annulus, the cells
  on either side of an open dividing line) each become individually
  selectable — not just simple closed loops
- **Region hover & multi-select** — hover a region in the viewport to
  highlight it; click to select, Ctrl+click to add more regions to a
  push/pull operation. A wider catch area around the boundary lines makes
  thin regions easy to grab
- **Manifold extrusion** — outer wire + inner wires get assembled into a
  single planar face with holes (e.g. a sketched ring extrudes into a tube)
- **Inline dimension input** — while placing a Line / Circle / Polygon /
  Rectangle, type the length, radius, or side directly; the value is
  applied from the click anchor toward the cursor direction
- **Live dimension overlay** — a measuring annotation (offset dimension line
  with arrowheads + value) follows the operation as you work: line length,
  circle **diameter**, both rectangle sides while sketching; depth while
  extruding; distance while moving a body with the gizmo
- **Snap** — to existing sketch points, to circle/arc perimeters, and
  threshold-based to grid lines (snaps only when close)
- **Adjustable grid step** — pick 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 10 mm; the same step
  drives the visual grid, sketch snap, and gizmo translate snap. Every 10th
  grid line is drawn brighter so larger distances are easy to read
- **Plane-aligned grid** — a base-plane sketch shows the world grid laid on
  the sketch plane (and visible in the orthographic sketch view); a sketch on
  a face shows a face-local measurement grid in the sketch's own 2D axes
- **Concentric / shared anchors** — clicking on an existing point in
  Circle / Polygon / Arc mode reuses that point so concentric shapes
  actually share a center vertex
- **Constraints**: Coincident, Horizontal, Vertical, Distance, Radius,
  Parallel, Perpendicular, Tangent, Equal, Concentric
- **Auto-constraining** — snaps to horizontal/vertical when lines are
  near-aligned

### Camera / View

- **Auto-orthographic on sketch entry** — when you start a sketch, the
  camera snaps to an orthographic view looking straight down the sketch's
  plane normal, framed to the source face
- **Pan and zoom preserve ortho**; **orbit** exits ortho back to perspective
- **"Look at Sketch"** button — appears in the sketch toolbar only when
  the camera isn't ortho, returns to the aligned ortho view
- **ViewCube** — Top / Bottom / Front / Back / Left / Right standard views,
  plus four rotate buttons (15° increments). Any ViewCube action exits the
  sketch ortho lock and re-frames the visible geometry

### Selection System

| Action | Selects |
|--------|---------|
| Click near edge | Edge (for Fillet/Chamfer) |
| Click on face | Face (for Extrude / Push&nbsp;Pull / Sketch on Face) |
| Click on sketch region | SketchRegion (for Push/Pull) |
| Double-click | Whole body (shows transform gizmo) |
| Ctrl+click | Add to multi-selection (faces, regions, edges, bodies) |
| Right-click face | Context menu (Sketch on Face, Extrude, Select Body) |
| Click empty space | Clear selection |

Selection is **occlusion-aware**: edges and sketch regions hidden behind a
solid can't be picked through it — only what's visible is selectable.

### Interactive Tools

All major operations provide **live preview** and an on-screen **measurement**
as you drag or type:

- **Push/Pull**: a face-normal arrow you drag (or type a distance); a mm readout
  follows it. Starts at 0 (no change). Also works on selected sketch regions.
- **Extrude**: drag in viewport or type distance (mm), slider, Enter to confirm
- **Fillet / Chamfer**: an outward drag handle on the edge sets the radius/distance
  (drag away from the edge to grow, from 0.1 mm), with a measurement and live
  preview; or type the value. Starts at 0 (no change).
- **Move (Gizmo)**: 3-axis arrows with threshold-based grid snap; mm readout.
- **Rotate (Gizmo)**: rings; free rotation that soft-snaps to 45°, degree readout.
- **Scale (Gizmo)**: per-axis cubes-on-bars (or uniform), 1% snap, percent readout,
  plus a side panel for exact X/Y/Z percentages.
- **Cancel mid-drag with Escape** — pressing Escape while still dragging
  a gizmo, an extrude, a push/pull, a fillet/chamfer, or a sketch tool
  reverts the body / cancels the preview so the model returns to exactly
  where it started

### Rendering

- PBR Cook-Torrance BRDF shading with tone mapping
- **Per-body colour** — bodies default to a uniform light grey; each row in the
  Items panel has a colour swatch that opens a hue-wheel picker
- 12 material presets (Steel, Aluminum, Copper, Gold, Plastics, Wood,
  Glass, Rubber, Ceramic, Concrete)
- Gradient background
- Edge wireframe overlay
- Per-face / per-edge / per-body / per-region selection highlighting
  (outline only, no z-fighting)
- Infinite grid (renders on the active sketch plane; emphasized every-10th lines)
- Construction plane visualization

### UI / UX

- **Adaptive toolbar** — shows relevant tools based on selection
  (nothing / edge / face / body / sketch / sketch region)
- **Design History** — every operation recorded, undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Y),
  breakpoints. Includes Push/Pull, deletes, gizmo moves, and sketch ops
- **Items panel** — bodies *and* sketches with visibility, rename (double-click
  or right-click), delete (Delete key or right-click), and a per-body **colour
  swatch** (right edge) that opens a hue-wheel picker. Body deletes are undoable.
- **Interactions panel** — a live reference of the viewport controls
  (camera / select / transform / sketch), docked above the Items panel; the
  camera rows reflect the current mouse bindings
- **Properties panel** — edit any operation's parameters after creation
- **Command Palette** (Ctrl+K) — fuzzy search all commands
- **Material panel** — assign PBR materials to bodies
- **Measure tool** — distance, area, edge length, bounding box
- **2D Drawing workspace** — Front/Top/Right/Isometric projections with
  DXF/SVG export
- **Section View** — cut through solids with interactive clipping plane
- **Transform Gizmo** — 3-axis arrows + rotation rings + scale cubes
- **Box / Marquee selection**
- **Dark / Light themes**
- **Status bar** — body count, selection info, current tool
- **Variables & Expressions** — named parameters (e.g. `width=50`,
  `height=width*0.6`)
- **Version snapshots** — auto-save + manual save with labels, restore
  any version
- **Settings** (File → Settings) — reassign which mouse buttons orbit and pan
- **Toast notifications**, **Keyboard Shortcuts panel**, **About dialog**

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites (Ubuntu / Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential cmake git \
  libocct-data-exchange-dev \
  libocct-draw-dev \
  libocct-foundation-dev \
  libocct-modeling-algorithms-dev \
  libocct-modeling-data-dev \
  libocct-visualization-dev \
  libgl-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev \
  libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
  libwayland-dev pkg-config
```

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/materializr.git
cd materializr
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Run

```bash
./build/materializr
```

### Test

```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Build AppImage (Docker)

Produces a portable single-file Linux executable:

```bash
./scripts/build-appimage.sh
# Output: dist/Materializr-<arch>.AppImage
```

Requires Docker with BuildKit. The AppImage bundles OCCT, TBB, and Freetype —
the user only needs base OpenGL/X11 drivers.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. With nothing selected, click **Sketch on XY / XZ / YZ** to sketch on a base
   plane — or select a face first
2. Click **Sketch on Face** (when a face is selected) — the camera snaps to an
   orthographic view straight at the face
3. Draw a closed profile (Rectangle, Circle, chain of Lines, …). Type
   exact dimensions during placement, or rely on grid snap
4. Click **Finish Sketch** — the sketch is saved to the Items panel
5. **Hover** an enclosed region of the sketch in the viewport; it
   highlights cyan. Click to select, Ctrl+click to add more regions
6. Click **Push / Pull** — drag positive to extrude, negative to cut

### Sketch on a Face

1. Click any planar face on a body
2. Click **Sketch on Face** in the toolbar, or right-click → *Sketch on this Face*
3. Draw on the face — sketch renders directly on the surface with a
   face-local measurement grid
4. Click **Finish Sketch** when done — the sketch persists in the Items panel
5. Re-enter it later via **Edit Sketch** to add concentric circles, holes, etc.

### Push / Pull a Region

1. Select one or more closed regions of a finished sketch
   (hover → click; Ctrl+click for multi)
2. Click **Push / Pull**
3. Type a distance or use the slider:
   - **Positive** = extrude outward, fused with the sketch's source body
     (or as a new body if free-floating)
   - **Negative** = cut into the source body
4. **Enter** to confirm, **Escape** to cancel

### Fillet / Chamfer

1. **Click near an edge** (within ~8 px) — edge highlights in green
2. **Ctrl+click** more edges to add to selection
3. Click **Fillet** or **Chamfer** in the toolbar
4. **Drag the outward handle** away from the edge to set the radius/distance
   (from 0.1 mm, with a measurement), or type a value / use the slider — live
   preview updates
5. **Enter** to confirm, **Escape** to cancel

### Transform with Gizmo

1. Double-click a body — gizmo appears
2. Drag **arrows** to move, **rings** to rotate, **cubes** to scale
3. With **Snap to grid** on, the translate axes snap to the current grid
   step (0.1 / 0.5 / 1 / 10 mm)
4. Release mouse — transform commits to history
5. **Escape mid-drag** restores the body to where it was before the drag

### Boolean Operations

1. **Ctrl+click** a face on body A, then **Ctrl+click** a face on body B
2. Click **Union**, **Subtract**, or **Intersect**
3. Unions auto-merge coplanar/cotangent neighbouring faces so the result
   has no spurious seam edge between the original bodies

The modeling operations, interactive tools, and IO formats are contributed
through a **plugin registry** (`src/plugin`): each feature in `src/plugins`
registers its toolbar buttons, commands, and handlers at startup, and the
adaptive toolbar surfaces them based on the current selection context.

**Key design patterns:**

- **Command Pattern** — every modeling operation is an undoable command
  stored in the design history. Push/Pull, fillet, chamfer, extrude,
  delete, transform — all undoable.
- **Linear History** — operations form a timeline that can be replayed,
  edited, or rolled back. Edit a past step and everything after replays.
- **Adaptive UI** — toolbar content changes based on selection type
  (nothing, face, edge, body, sketch, sketch region).
- **Interactive Preview** — push/pull, extrude, fillet, chamfer, and the
  transform gizmo all show live results as you type or drag, then commit
  to history on confirm. Escape during the drag reverts to the state
  before the operation started.
- **Separation of Concerns** — geometry kernel (OCCT), UI (ImGui), and
  rendering (OpenGL) are cleanly separated.
