# Plan Review Log: Move Face commit adoption

Started 2026-09-12. MAX_ROUNDS=2. Codex CLI 0.153.4, model gpt-5.6-sol.

## Round 1 — Codex

1. **Controller test optional despite the existing harness already exposing `commitMoveFace()`.** Op-level tests and the bench can't catch a caching/offering wiring bug.
   Fix: require a controller-level landed-preview -> commit test with a deterministic adoption signal, not a skippable one.
2. **The proposed timing assertion is flaky and doesn't prove adoption.** Scheduler load, OCCT caching, fixture variance can pass/fail independently of whether the adopt branch ran.
   Fix: a deterministic observer/counter for adopt vs recompute.
3. **The preview-key test only checks non-empty, not correctness.** A malformed key would still pass.
   Fix: assert exact equality against an independently-configured op's own `previewKey()`.
4. **Key correctness under-tested.** Only different Kinds are compared; per-field omissions (explicit rotation, twist, scale uniform/non-uniform, moveOuter, holeSlant, holeVertical) aren't caught.
   Fix: table-driven tests, one per field, asserting the key changes.
5. **Landed cache isn't cleared everywhere the header comment implies.** `commitMoveFace()` and `cancelMoveFace()` retain two OCCT shape graphs until the next `beginMoveFace()`.
   Fix: clear all three fields on every commit/cancel exit path, immediately after offering.
6. **No observability for adoption hit/miss.** Production regressions would look like unexplained freezes.
   Fix: lightweight diagnostic logging.
7. **The benchmark bypasses the controller code where the likely bugs are.** Manually injecting `previewResult.shape/key` into an op proves Task 1/2 only, not that `pollPreview()`/`commitMoveFace()` wire it correctly.
   Fix: benchmark (or test) through the real `MoveFaceController` harness.
8. **`abandon()` doesn't cancel the worker; a Confirm-mid-flight fallback can run concurrently with it, contending for CPU** — the plan's "exactly today's cost" claim ignores this.
   Fix: reap/take an already-finished result first, or introduce cancellation/a bounded handoff policy.
9. **The throwaway-bench cleanup (`git checkout -- tests/CMakeLists.txt`) can discard unrelated uncommitted work** in that file.
   Fix: verify the file is clean before editing, or remove only the added hunk by hand.
10. **The adopted path skips all of MoveFaceOp's own result-validity guards** (`BRepCheck_Analyzer`, solid/shell count, volume ratio) — the marker() test proves an arbitrary shape can land.
    Fix: restrict precomputed injection to the real preview pipeline and/or re-run the cheap structural guards before `applyResult()`.

VERDICT: REVISE

### Claude's response

Verified two things directly before responding: (a) `tests/test_move_face_async.cpp` already builds a real `MoveFaceController` + `IopContext` harness and an existing test already calls `mfc.commitMoveFace(ctx)` directly — a controller-level test is fully reachable, not merely aspirational; (b) `MoveFaceController::cancelMoveFace()` (line 1887) has its own independent `m_mfJob.abandon()`/`m_mfDispatch.reset()`/`m_mfPendingJob.reset()` block, confirming point 5's "not cleared everywhere" claim was correct.

**Acted on: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.**
- 1+2+7 resolved together: replaced the optional, timing-based Step 5 with two REQUIRED deterministic controller-level tests using `TopoDS_Shape::IsEqual` (proves adoption via literal-shape-identity, which a fresh recompute can never produce even if geometrically equal) and an independent-recompute geometric comparison (proves the fallback path stays correct) — no counters needed, matching this test file's own established idiom rather than inventing a new one.
- 3 resolved: the preview-key test now asserts exact string equality against an independently-configured op's `previewKey()`, not just non-emptiness.
- 4 resolved: added `MoveFacePreviewKeyIsSensitiveToEveryField`, a table-driven test covering every field for every Kind (Translate/Rotate implicit+explicit/Twist/Scale uniform+non-uniform, moveOuter/holeSlant/holeVertical).
- 5 resolved: added clearing to `cancelMoveFace()` (previously only planned for `beginMoveFace()`), and added immediate clearing in `commitMoveFace()` right after the candidate is offered (whether or not it's adopted), so nothing outlives the exit path that consumed it.
- 6 resolved proportionally: added an `isVerbose()`-gated stderr line reporting whether commit had a landed preview to offer, matching this codebase's existing diagnostic convention (e.g. `applyRevolve`'s `[Revolve] applied: ...` line) — declined a deeper adopted-vs-recomputed introspection flag, since none of Shell/Taper/ScaleFace expose one either and adding one would mean extending the shared `Operation::Precomputed` base for observability alone, beyond this plan's bound.
- 9 resolved: added a Step 0 (`git status --porcelain`/`git diff` on `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, must be clean) before editing it, and made Step 3's cleanup conditional on that check instead of an unconditional `git checkout --`.

**Declined: 8, 10** (full reasoning now in the plan's new "Declined findings" section):
- 8: the CPU-contention scenario already exists in the currently-shipped code on EVERY commit (unconditional `abandon()` + unconditional synchronous `execute()`); this plan doesn't introduce or worsen it, and adoption makes it fire strictly less often. Corrected the plan's imprecise "exactly today's cost" wording instead of building `AsyncJob` cancellation (a larger, cross-cutting change touching Shell/Taper/ScaleFace/PushPull too).
- 10: `ShellOp`'s existing, already-shipped adopt branch has the identical property (skips its own recompute-path validation on adopt) — this is structural to the shared mechanism (the worker's own successful `execute()` already ran the guards once; re-running them at commit is redundant and would erase part of the performance win). Fixing it would mean re-architecting `Operation::Precomputed` across four operations, out of this plan's bound.

## Round 2 — Codex

1. **The table-driven key test doesn't compile.** The `"moveOuter"` mutation lambda captures nothing (`[]`) but uses `hs9`/`hv9`.
   Fix: capture by reference (`[&]`).
2. **The "every field" key test still omits fields.** Never independently varies the implicit rotation axis, non-uniform scale axis A/B or factor A, or the selected face.
   Fix: add mutations for all of those, asserting each changes the key.
3. **The `isVerbose()` diagnostic won't compile as placed.** `FaceOpControllers.cpp` doesn't include `core/Verbose.h`.
   Fix: add the include.
4. **The diagnostic reports "offered," not "adopted."** A stale candidate that fails `canAdopt()` logs identically to a successful adopt, so the actual observability gap (silently expensive fallback) remains open.
   Fix: log the real decision from inside `MoveFaceOp::execute()`, distinguishing no-candidate / stale-candidate-rejected / adopted.
5. **Commit-time cache clearing is still incomplete.** Only the general `MoveFaceOp` branch clears it; the hole-mode early return, the local-tweak branch, and the no-op fall-through (`faceXformNontrivial()` false) all retain the landed shapes.
   Fix: clear unconditionally, once, near the top of `commitMoveFace()`, via a common path all branches share.
6. **`IsEqual()` alone isn't deterministic proof of adoption vs recomputation** — it observes shape identity, not which code path ran.
   Fix: a narrowly-scoped counter/hook, asserting zero recomputations on adopt and exactly one on fallback.
7. **The stale-key fallback test doesn't assert commit succeeded**, and volume+centroid are weak equivalence checks for perforated geometry.
   Fix: assert the history step count advanced; use a stronger geometric-equality check (e.g. symmetric-difference volume) against the direct V2 recompute.
8. **Finding 8's declined reasoning is substantially correct** — verified directly against the current code: `commitMoveFace()` already calls `abandon()` immediately before synchronous recomputation today, and `abandon()` parks rather than cancels. No scope change required.
9. **Finding 10's declined reasoning is substantially correct** — verified directly: Shell/Taper/ScaleFace already adopt without repeating their own validation, and `MoveFacePreviewJob` only returns `ok=true` after the same `execute()` validation already succeeded. No duplicate validation needed; documented `setPrecomputedResult()` as trusted-internal input for future callers.

VERDICT: REVISE

### Claude's response

All seven actionable findings (1-7) were real and are now fixed in the plan:
- 1: fixed the capture bug.
- 2: added mutations for implicit rotation axis (previously only angle was varied), non-uniform scale axis A, axis B, and factor A (previously only "switch to non-uniform" and factor B were tested), and a face-selection change (a second, distinct face on the same base).
- 3: added `#include "core/Verbose.h"` to `MoveFaceOp.cpp` (not `FaceOpControllers.cpp` — the diagnostic moved into `MoveFaceOp::execute()` itself as part of resolving finding 4, so it no longer needs to compile in the controller file at all).
- 4 + 6 resolved together, more thoroughly than either finding asked alone: added two process-wide static counters (`MoveFaceOp::adoptedCount()`/`recomputedCount()`) incremented at the actual adopt/recompute branch points inside `execute()`, plus `isVerbose()`-gated stderr lines that distinguish "adopted" from "a candidate was offered but rejected" (the specific case finding 4 said was invisible). The two controller-level tests from round 1 now assert exact before/after counter deltas as the PRIMARY proof, with `IsEqual`/`!IsEqual` kept as a corroborating secondary check rather than the sole proof.
- 5: restructured `commitMoveFace()` to capture the landed cache into local variables and unconditionally clear the three member fields immediately after the existing `abandon()`/`reset()` block, before any of the function's several branches - every exit path now consumes the cache exactly once, using the locals for the actual offer.
- 7: added a `ctx.history.currentStep()` before/after check (proves the commit actually pushed a step, not a silent no-op) and replaced the volume+centroid comparison with a symmetric-difference-volume check (`BRepAlgoAPI_Cut` both directions, assert each side's leftover volume is ~0) against the independent V2 recompute - a standard, robust OCCT shape-equality technique, not sensitive to perforation complexity the way a single scalar comparison is.

Findings 8 and 9 (my round-1 declines) were independently verified as correct by Codex against the actual code, not accepted on my word - no further action.

**Process note**: this is Round 2 of MAX_ROUNDS=2 - the loop's hard cap is reached here, per this skill's own termination rule (no unbounded recursion). This is being treated as a capped-out state, not a genuine deadlock: every substantive finding (1-7) was actionable and has been fixed; findings 8-9 were an explicit, verified CONVERGENCE (Codex confirmed my reasoning was correct against the real code), not a live disagreement needing a human tie-break. Per Step 3's human gate, this goes back to the user with that framing rather than silently spending an unauthorized third round.
